## Employee Profile Photo Feature Implementation

### What was implemented:

1. **Schema Updates:**
   - Added `profilePhoto` field to employee creation schema (optional File type)
   - Updated Employee type to include `profilePhotoId` and `profilePhotoUrl` fields

2. **Backend Changes:**
   - Updated Appwrite client to include Storage service
   - Modified employee creation endpoint to handle FormData instead of JSON
   - Added photo upload functionality to Appwrite Storage
   - Generate public URLs for uploaded photos

3. **Frontend Updates:**
   - Updated employee creation form to include photo upload component
   - Added drag & drop photo upload with preview
   - File validation (5MB limit, image files only)
   - Updated employee list to display profile photos using Avatar component
   - Enhanced employee dashboard with profile photo in header
   - Updated UserButton component to show employee profile photos

4. **Database Schema:**
   - Added `profilePhotoId` (string, optional) - stores Appwrite file ID
   - Added `profilePhotoUrl` (URL, optional) - stores public image URL

5. **Storage Setup:**
   - Configured to use existing Appwrite storage bucket
   - Added proper permissions for file access

### How it works:

1. **Admin creates employee:** Admin can now upload a profile photo when creating an employee account
2. **Photo processing:** Image is uploaded to Appwrite Storage and a public URL is generated
3. **Profile display:** Employee's photo appears in:
   - Employee management list
   - Employee dashboard header
   - Navigation user button (top-right)
   - User dropdown menu

### Usage:
1. Admin navigates to Employee Management
2. Clicks "Add Employee" 
3. Fills in required fields and optionally uploads a profile photo
4. Employee logs in and sees their photo in the dashboard and navigation

### Technical Notes:
- Photos are stored in Appwrite Storage bucket
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Photos are publicly accessible via Appwrite CDN
- Fallback to initials if no photo is uploaded

The feature is now fully implemented and ready for testing!
