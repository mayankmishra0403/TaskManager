# PWA Setup Instructions

Your Task Manager is now configured as a Progressive Web App (PWA)! Here's what you need to do:

## 1. Create App Icons

Generate icons in the following sizes and place them in `/public/icons/`:
- `icon-16x16.png`
- `icon-32x32.png`
- `icon-72x72.png`
- `icon-96x96.png`
- `icon-128x128.png`
- `icon-144x144.png`
- `icon-152x152.png`
- `icon-192x192.png`
- `icon-384x384.png`
- `icon-512x512.png`

Shortcut icons:
- `shortcut-task.png` (96x96)
- `shortcut-mytasks.png` (96x96)
- `shortcut-dashboard.png` (96x96)

## 2. Test PWA Features

### Installation:
1. Open your website on Chrome (mobile/desktop)
2. Look for "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Follow installation instructions

### Features Available:
- âœ… Offline support
- âœ… Auto-updates (checks every 30 seconds)
- âœ… Home screen installation
- âœ… App shortcuts
- âœ… Share target (share text to create tasks)
- âœ… Caching for better performance

## 3. Testing Checklist

### Desktop (Chrome):
1. Open Developer Tools â†’ Application â†’ Manifest
2. Check if manifest loads correctly
3. Test "Add to Desktop" functionality

### Mobile (Android):
1. Open in Chrome browser
2. Menu â†’ "Install App" or "Add to Home Screen"
3. Test offline functionality
4. Check app shortcuts (long press on icon)

## 4. Auto-Update Behavior

Your PWA will automatically:
- Check for updates every 30 seconds when active
- Update when the browser tab becomes visible
- Reload the app when updates are available
- Cache API responses and static assets

## 5. Deployment Notes

### For Vercel:
- PWA files will be generated in `/public/` during build
- Service worker will be served from `/sw.js`
- No additional configuration needed

### Manual Testing:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and test PWA features.

## 6. Customization

Edit `/public/manifest.json` to customize:
- App name and description
- Theme colors
- App shortcuts
- Share target behavior

## 7. Important Notes

- PWA only works over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Service worker is disabled in development mode
- Users will get install prompts automatically
- App updates happen seamlessly without user intervention
- Offline page shows when no internet connection

Your app is now ready to be installed as a native-like app on any device! ðŸš€
