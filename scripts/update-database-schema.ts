/**
 * Database Schema Notes
 * 
 * The employee management system has been simplified to work without project assignments.
 * Employees are created with basic information and workspace membership only.
 * 
 * Current employee schema includes:
 * - name: string
 * - email: string  
 * - employeeId: string
 * - department: string
 * - workspaceId: string
 * - userId: string (linked to Appwrite Auth)
 * - createdBy: string
 * - isActive: boolean
 * 
 * This setup works with the existing Appwrite collection structure.
